# UX/UI Challenge

v2.0

## Description

Thanks for taking the time to work on this project.

At the following URL: [https://www.figma.com/file/8AthvbJmB5qA9hdUbC7SSt/Filters?node-id=0-1&t=NjxJNIDxvSfW6x7D-0](https://www.figma.com/file/8AthvbJmB5qA9hdUbC7SSt/Filters?node-id=0-1&t=NjxJNIDxvSfW6x7D-0) you find a Figma board representing a dropdown component and some of its states (open, closed, empty, selected, ...). The task is to implement this component using React with TypeScript.

The component is part of an internal UI library and it needs to be designed to be reusable and with well defined `props`.

1. The list of options must be passed as a prop from the outside

2. The component must handle callback when filters are selected/unselected

We are asking you to:

1. Add your code in this repository and open a Pull Request when you think you have finished.

2. Host your work somewhere on the web and add the link to the PR **OR** create a zip file with the static build of your project and attach it to the PR, so that we will have a running version of the component to play with.

We will look at the final results in the browser and at the structure of the code, when we'll meet these are some examples of questions:

* Which assumptions have you made?
* What is allowing the component to be reusable in your proposal?
* What is allowing the component to be customisable in your proposal?
* How have you enforced the quality of the solution? (i.e. which tests)
